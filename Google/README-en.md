# Google Advanced Search Assistant

**Attention: Since this is a script under development, it could only provide Chinese UI now!**

This is a user script that adds an advanced search form to Google. It adds a collapsible advanced search form at the top of the page, allowing you to search for information with more precision.

## Features

- Adds an "Advanced Search" button at the top of the Google search page. Clicking the button will display the advanced search form.

  - "Exact word or phrase": The search results must include an exact match of the specified word or phrase.
  - "Any of these words": The search results must include any of the specified keywords.
  - "None of these words": The search results must not include the specified keywords.

  - "Site or domain": The search results must include results from the specified website or domain.
  - "File type": The search results must include results of the specified file type.
- The script can save previous search options, so the form will be automatically filled when opening a new page.
